===========

This is an example of some backend development work I was asked to do for Atlanta Westside Presbyterian Church.

Here are the project details:
* Integrate the savior WordPress Theme event calendar with CCB (a church management sytem)
* Create new post categories for managing staff (Deacon, Elders, etc.)
* Create a way manage uploaded sermons and automate CRUD operation to their RSS feed and on iTunes

Thanks for checking out my project :)
